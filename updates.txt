29/11/2012 Bug fixes (v1.0.1)

Updated "gentumourstatetable.m" to incorporate a "normal" homozygosity state (state 3) to account for runs of homozygotes that are not due to somatic LOH. The "normal, heterozygous" state is now labelled as state 4.

Updated "segment.m" to join State 3 and 4 as a single state by manually relabelling State 3 as State 4.

Updated the Perl script "process_pileup.pl" to remove a piece of testing code that only prints every 100th line and added a new parameter to allow the specification of a target snps file in BED format.



14/02/2013 Bug fixes and upgrades (v1.0.2)

Fixed bug in reporting of LOH states.

Fixed bug in calculation of BAF likelihood.

Added ability to specify tumour states.

Created MATLAB Compiler version.



14/09/2013 Upgrades (v1.0.3)

Added support for gzipped and zip data file inputs.


22/11/2013 Upgrades (v1.0.4)

Added support for normal-tumour pair analysis for Illumina and Complete Genomics.

Minor algorithmic tweaks to achieve 10-20% speed ups when using tumour heterogeneity mode.


7/1/2014 (v1.0.5)

Added code to output diagnostic information in MAT files.


14/1/2014 (v2.0)

Updated model to allow joint inference of tumour heterogeneity and tumour state variables.


4/4/2014 (v2.0)

Fixed bug in calculation of outlier state likelihood calculation and for balanced genotypes. 

Added minor copy number display on plots.

Used beta prior on intra-tumor heterogeneity levels.


14/08/2014 (v2.1)
